=========================================================================

==============
ABOUT:
==============
The species-specific RefSeq directories provide a cumulative 
set of records for transcripts and proteins for those species. 

In representing the complete cumulative set of transcripts and proteins, 
the sequence files include all RefSeq accessions available for the organism; 
note that model XM_, XR_, and XP_ accessions are included in addition to 
the known RefSeq complement with NM_, NR_, and NP_ accessions.  

These directories are updated on a weekly basis; the update is typically
installed on Tuesdays:
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/B_taurus/
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/D_rerio/
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/M_musculus/
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/R_norvegicus/
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/S_scrofa/
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/X_tropicalis/

SUB-DIRECTORIES:
==========================

{SPECIES_ABBREV}: a link to related FTP area where the genome, genome annotation,
	          and genome assembly sequence reports are provided.

mRNA_Prot directory
   Contents: organisms-specific RefSeq transcript and protein data

     {org-name}.files.installed: 
         reports the md5checksum and files included in the directory
         For example: /refseq/H_sapiens/mRNA_Prot/human.files.installed

   File Name Conventions:
	File name formats are as follows:
 	     common_name.#.molecule_type.format_type
        Multiple files may be provided for any given molecule and format type and file 
	names include a numerical increment.  Files with the same numerical increment
	are related by content. 

	For example, the files provided for human are named as:
 	      human.#.rna.fna.gz --fasta report for transcript records
 	      human.#.protein.faa.gz --fasta report for protein records
 	      human.#.rna.gbff.gz  --flatfile report for transcript records
 	      human.#.protein.gpff.gz --flatfile report for protein records

RefSeqGene directory:   
   genomic gene-region sequence data that is provided to support the RefSeqGene project 
   and Clinical Testing labs. Genomic records in scope for reporting to this FTP 
   directory can be identified by the presence of the keyword 'RefSeqGene'.
	     
   Available in: H_sapiens directory
   See also:  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/RSG/ 
   Files provided:
	 gene_RefSeqGene -- a gene-to-accession mapping file 
		            tab delimited columns are 
		            tax_id GeneID symbol NG_accession.version	        
	 LRG_RefSeqGene  -- a LRG to RefSeqGene mapping file
		            tab delimited columns are
		            GeneID  symbol  LRG_ID RefSeqGene accession.version
	 RefSeqGene#.genomic.molecule_type.format_type --sequence reports; see above
	 RefSeqGene_standards -- reports genomic and transcript reference standards
				        tab delimited columns are
					GeneID   symbol  NG or NM accession.version
                                        # Note NG = genomic; NM = transcript
